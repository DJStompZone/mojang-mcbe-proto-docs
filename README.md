## Network Protocol Documentation for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

### A note from Mojang
> We share our Network Protocol with server partners so they can write their own Minecraft servers with their own code. This documentation compiles a series of tree diagrams that define the structure of the packets used by the Protocol, as well as related classes and enums.
> Protocol is subject to change release over release.


### Version

Current Release - r/21_u2

## Usage

A web version of the documentation can be viewed [here](https://djstompzone.github.io/mojang-mcbe-proto-docs/).
Aesthetically, it is currently extremely minimalistic. A CSS rework in order to make the documentation more presentable is currently being considered.
